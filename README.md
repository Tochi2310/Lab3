# Lab3
This is the third coding assignment (Lab 3) of the semester in CSC 172 and I made this in eclipse. This lab had 3 different parts to it. In part 1 (labelled as task1 in the code) I had to print a formatted 4x4 two dimensional integer array and a formated 2d list. For part 2 (labelled as task 2 in the code), I made a method that outputs a modified 4x4 2D integer array after producing the running sums according to the inputted direction. And for part 3, I made methods that iterate different ArrayLists in order to print integers. While loops and for loops were used to satisfy the requirements for part 3.
